/**
 * HTTP/1.1 content decompressor that bounds how far a response body may inflate, mirroring what
 * {@link Http2ContentDecompressor} enforces on HTTP/2 streams.
 * <p>
 * Netty's own {@code maxAllocation} argument is not such a bound. It caps the capacity of the one output
 * buffer produced by a single {@code ZlibDecoder.decode()} call, and nothing accumulates across calls.
 * AHC hands the decompressor one {@code HttpContent} of at most {@code httpClientCodecMaxChunkSize}
 * (8 KiB by default) at a time, so even DEFLATE's ~1032:1 ceiling keeps a single call's output around
 * 8 MiB — under any sane limit — while the response as a whole inflates without bound. The cap therefore
 * never fires on an ordinary decompression bomb.
 * <p>
 * The counting is done inside the decoder's own {@link EmbeddedChannel} rather than around
 * {@code HttpContentDecoder#decode}: that class forwards decompressed output straight down the outer
 * pipeline through an internal forwarder installed at the end of the embedded pipeline, so the output
 * never passes through the {@code decode} out-list where it could be measured. Sitting between the
 * {@code ZlibDecoder} and that forwarder gives an exact count of what decompression produced — and only
 * of that, so an unencoded response, which never gets a decoder, is passed through untouched and is
 * never failed for being large; its size is the caller's own choice, not a bomb.
 * <p>
 * A decoder is created per response, so each response gets a fresh counter even though this handler is
 * shared by every response on a keep-alive connection.
